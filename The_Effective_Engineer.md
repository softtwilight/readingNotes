## 1.Leverage
	Leverage = Impact Product / Time Invested
	3 questions:
		1. how can i complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?
		2. how can i increse the value produced by this activity?
		3. Is there something else that I could spend my time on that would produce more value?
	
	focus on high-leverage activities.

> "If you want to have a big impact, you need a leverage point-a way to put in a dollar of funding or an hour of 
 effort and benefit society by a hundred of a thousand times as much"  -- Bill Gates.

## 2.Optimize for Learning
	Optimizing for learning is a high-leverage activity.
	Adopting a growth mindset is a prerequisit for improving out abilities.
	
	Compounding , Exponential Growth
	1. learning follows an exponential growth curve.
	2. even samll deltas in your learning rate make a big difference over the long run.
	3. the earlier, the better. A good first job make it easier to get a better second one.
	
	Coninuous iteration. behave as a startup. long term success.

### Seek work environments conducive to learing.
Six factors to consider when choosing a new job  
1. Fast growth. "If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, you don't ask what seat."  
2. Training
3. Openness
4. Pace
5. People
6. Autonomy

### Dedicate Time on the job to Develop new Skills.
20 % time to do a side work.
learning adjacent disciplines.
- Study code for core abstractions written by the best engineers at your company.
- write more code.
- Send your code reviews to the harshest critics.
- Participate in design discussions of projects you'r interested in.
- Work on a diversity of projects.
- Make sure you'r on a team with one you can learn from.
- Jump fearlessly into code you don't know.

### Always Be Learning
- Learning new programming languages and frameworks.
- Invest in skills that are in high demand.
- Read books.
- Join a discussion group.
- Build and maintain a strong network of relationships.
- Follow bloggers who teach.
- Write to teach.
- Tinker on side projects.
- Pursue what you love.

## 3.Prioritize Regularly

Woring on a task means not working on another.So regular prioritization is a high-leverage activity.

Hard, require practice.

### Track Todos in a Single, Easily Accessible List.

- checklists drastically reduce errors.Pilots check pre-flight lists, surgeons check operation list, construction manager check safety list.
- The first step of effective prioritization is listing every task.
- short memory, 7 items, deliberate remembering reduce our attention, inpair decision-making abilities.free the mind
- Task list should be simple, and only one master list.(只记录在一个地方)
- 用leverage来判断优先级，只需要排序最高的几个就可以了

### Focus on What Directly Produces Value

- meeting，writing status reports...only hava a weak and indirect connection to creating value.
- When you get the important things right, the small things often don't matter.
- Prioritize the ones that produces the most value with the least amount of effort.
- Don't try to get everthing done. Focus on what matters-produces more value.

### Focus on the Important and Non-Urgent.

- Investing in Quadrant 2 solutions can reduce urgent task and stress. 

- Planning / Building relations / New opportunities/ Personal development are things in Quadrant 2.

### Protect Your Maker's Schedule

- create block time. protect your time.

### Limit the Amount of Work in Progress

- Increasing work linearly increases the likelihood of failure exponentiallly.
- 《your brain at work》working memory like a small stage, When we work on many things simultaneously, we spend most of our brain resources moving actor on and off rather that outwork.

### Fight Procrastination with If-Then Plans
- It's difficult to start a difficult task.
- If-Then plan: If you want do sth, write down **when,where,how** you do it.
- Ex:"If 9 pm, Then I will coding", "If I have 20 minutes, I will remember Japanese word."

### Make a Routine of Prioritization
- If it's beginning of the week, then I add tasks I want to accomplish this week, put unfinashed work from previous week.

## 4.Invest in Iteration Speed

Continuous deployment

- allow incremental, small changes.
- instantly

### Move Fast to Learn Fast

learning compounds.

### Invest in Time-Saving Tools

> I've found that almost all successful people write a lot of tools..A very good indicator of future success was if the first thing someone did on a problem was to write a tool.

> If you have to do something manually more than twice, then write a tool for the third time.

Time-saving tools pay off large dividends.

Start small, find an area where a tool could save time, build it, and demonstrate its value.

### Shorten Your Debugging and Validation Loops

Much of our engineering time on these two activities.

after repeatedly going through the same motion, take a moment to think through where you able to tighten that testing loop.

> Effective engineers hava an obsessive ability to create tight feedback loops for what ther're testing.

### Master Your Programming Environment

Mastery is a process, invest some time.

Be mindful of which of your common, everyday actions slow you down, and how to do efficiently.

- Get proficient with your favoiter text editor or IDE.
- Learn at least one productive, high-level programming language.
- Get familiar with unix shell commands.
- Prefer the keyboard over the mouse.
- Automate your manual workflows. Like shells, extensions, etc.
- Test out ideas on an interactive interpreter. Compile is costing.
- Make it fast and easy to run just the unit tests associated with your current changes.

### Don't Ignore Your Non-Engineering Bottlenecks

Identify the biggest bottlenecks, figure out how to eliminate them.

Communication is critical for making progress on people-related bottlenecks.

Be active when depend on others.

## 5.Measure What You Want to Improve
